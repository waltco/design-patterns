# Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern is a software design pattern that **restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance and provides access to that instance throughout the application**. In other words, it **ensures that only one object of a particular class is created in the entire application.**

Here is an example of implementing the Singleton Pattern in Java:

```
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance = null;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // add other methods and variables as needed
}

```

In this example, the `Singleton` class has a private constructor, preventing the instantiation of the class from outside. The class also has a static `getInstance()` method, which checks if an instance of the class has already been created. If not, it creates a new instance and returns it. If an instance already exists, it simply returns that instance.

To create an instance of the `Singleton` class, simply call the `getInstance()` method:

```
Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance();

```

This will always return the same instance of the class throughout the entire application.
